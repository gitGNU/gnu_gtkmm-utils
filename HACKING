Working with git
================

When you checkout the code for the first time:

     git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/gtkmm-utils.git

cd to the gtkmm-utils directory, create a branch for any work that
you will be doing and switch your working tree to that branch with:

    git checkout -b mystuff

Now work as usual, committing chunks of changes with

    git commit -a -m "Your commit message."

When you're done and want to submit your changes...
