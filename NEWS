Release 0.2.0 (2007-09-27)
==========================

New Tile API
------------

Tiles are intuitive widgets for a better user experience, by default composed
of an image, highlighted title and a short description. They offer important
extensibility not available when building a GtkTreeView-based interface.
Very similar UI components are currently used by the Beagle search
tool (http://beagle-project.org). This release introduces the Tile widget,
TileView, a container, and optional PageNavigator, which can together provide
an integrated page-separated view.

Logging
-------

The logging framework is now optionally thread-aware, which means that calling
Initializer::do_init() (ie initializing Glib threading) is not obligatory
any more (bug #21008, Jonathon Jongsma).

Documentation
-------------

The Doxygen documentation has been updated to cover the tile API, while the
existing has been corrected where necessary.

Build scripts
-------------

The API version is now hardcoded to 1.0. It is does not mean that it is stable,
but rather an important clarification: the (target) API version is 1.0, while
the releases are currently 0.x. This also means that from now on the headers
will be installed in $prefix/include/gtkmm-utils-1.0/gtkmm-utils/.

Release 0.1.0 (2007-08-26)
==========================

Imported the logging framework originally written by Dodji Seketeli, available
in Nemiver (http://home.gna.org/nemiver). Together with some date, option
parsing, string and dialog utility function, it made the first release.
