gtkmm-utils
===========

Utility functions, classes and widgets written on top of gtkmm and glibmm.

 - logging framework
 - option parsing, date and string utilities
 - tile widgets
 - dialog helpers

gtkmm is the official C++ API for GTK+, a graphical user interface toolkit
used in the GNOME desktop.

Large portions of the code in gtkmm-utils have been originally written
by Dodji Seketeli, and published under GPLv2 as part of Nemiver.
We have both agreed to relicence it in this library under LGPLv2 and thus
make it available to a larger audience of developers.
