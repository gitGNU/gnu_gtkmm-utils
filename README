gtkmm-utils
===========

Utility functions, classes and widgets written on top of gtkmm and glibmm.

That is the plan; currently, there is really just one reason why you'd
want to use and depend on this library: the extensive and very simple
to use logging framework. There are plans for further work, even existing
code to merge, but this will happen one step at a time; the project is
at its' beginning.

gtkmm is the official C++ API for GTK+, with bindings for other GNOME
libraries too.

Large portions of the code in gtkmm-utils have been originally written
by Dodji Seketeli, and published under GPLv2 as part of Nemiver.
We have both agreed to relicence it in this library under LGPLv2 and thus
make it available to a larger audience of developers.

Code is maintained in a git repository. To do an anonymous checkout, do:

git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/gtkmm-utils.git

If you have any questions or ideas, please email me directly. Once I see
that there are a few people interested in the project, I'll set up a
mailing list.
